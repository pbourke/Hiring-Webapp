Problem

The technical hiring process at many firms is broken and lacks good tool support to make the best decision.

Elaboration

What's broken?

- Defining the competencies / focus areas for a given interview
- Gathering data on candidates within the set of competencies in a structured fashion through the interview/evaluation process
- Asking meaningful questions targetted to the areas of interest
- Collecting resources and notes on a given candidate
    - code samples
    - phone screen audio
    - publicly available code (open-sorce contributions ie github)
    - blog entries, journal papers, published articles and books
- Moving a candidate through a structured workflow
- Facilitating meaningful, structured dialogue about a candidate (ie: comments)

What's the most broken?

- The hardest problem is gathering structured data - creating a process by which interviewers are incented and supported in gathering required information about a candidates competencies and plugging that information into a feedback loop which lets subsequent interviewers know what to focus on.
- Using this structured data in decision support

Solution

- a web-based application which lets you define competencies, gather data within the competencies via interviews, code samples and public information and evaluate those competencies using a rating-type system.
- the solution removes the time/cost burden of gathering this information and supports the interviewer in gathering good data and the team in making a good hiring decision

Who will use it? (Roles)

- Coordinators - recruiter / admin who inducts the candidate into the pipeline and performs scheduling and communication
- Hring Managers - who define the core competencies for a position and contribute to a hiring decision
- Interviewers / Evaluators - who gather data, assess an individual within the competencies and contribute to a hiring decision
- Non-Hiring Managers - who measure and monitor a set of hiring processes

What is the Minimum Viable Product? (MVP)

- Add an interviewer
- Add a recruiter/admin
- Define a Job, which consists of a description and a set of competencies
- As a recruiter, add a new candidate
- Add a candidate's resume
- Schedule a phone screen with the candidate and assign the phone screen and a set of competencies to a particular interviewer
- Provide feedback on the interview, which consists of notes and a rating in each of the competencies
- perform subsequent phone screens if desired
- Schedule an onsite interview loop with one or more interviewers
- Assign competencies to each interviewer to rate
- Allow each interviewer to add interview feedback
- Allow the recruiter to close out a candidate (hired, pulled out, rejected, etc) and provide a note
- Display the history and details for a given candidate

Who is the target market?

- Teams within small to medium sized companies who are hiring technical professionals
